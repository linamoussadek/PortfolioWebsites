            <p>I'm Owen Halvorson, a third-year student in the honors computer science bachelor degree program at the University of Ottawa. I grew up in Toronto, Ontario and I've always had a passion for Computer Science. I love writing code in languages such as Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, C++, C, Rust, Visual Basic, and more! I am interested in all fields of software development and have lots of experience through either work or projects, you can view some of my experiences on this website but even more on my LinkedIn or GitHub.<br><br>

                I also have a strong interest towards artificial intelligence. I enjoy reading about data science, machine learning, deep learning, and optimization approaches.<br><br>
                In September of 2023, I came up with a startup idea and I recruited a few friends to begin developing it. I have been managing this startup since and we are hoping to have a product ready by end of summer!

            <h3>Tic Tac Toe Project</h3>
            <p>This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript and PHP in order to allow the user to have the experience of playing Tic-Tac-Toe against a friend. The system uses various javascript functions to make ajax requests and display results returned from PHP backend that holds game state and leaderboard.
                PostgreSQL is used to store user information and see current users. The UI is Neon Styled.</p>

            <h3>E-commerce Website</h3>
            <p>This project is a full stack website and involves using MySQL as the back-end database and javascript, CSS, html to form the functionality and front-end. I used the react framework to build this website. I also have a server application that the website interacts with using express. The website is still a work in progress as I am working on a secure way to handle payments and create automated requests to shipping. I am hoping to deploy and maintain this application using a cloud service, either Google Cloud or AWS.</p>

            <h3>Gutters and Windows Website</h3>
            <p>This was a project made for a friend who was starting a window and gutter cleaning company in 2023. He wanted a quick website built to allow potentials customers to read about his buisiness. I built a website that fits those needs with multiple different pages in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. He was originally going to use resurva to schedule his appointments with customers but instead I built a backend database and allowed for customers to view and make appointments, notifying the business by email once that happens. That was made using NodeJS and MySQL.</p>

            <p>I wanted to explore making an app that involves chatting online. I made this app with my friend, it uses a node JS backend with the getstream.io API for chatting. This app includes chatting through texts and photos, activity status, reacting to messaging, and voice/video calling.</p>

            <p>This application was made using Android Studio and Java, with firebase as the database that stores user information. It was made as a version of uber eats but where the food sold is home-made food from home-made cooks. Features of the app can be seen in the photos, each have a desciption of the page under them.</p>
