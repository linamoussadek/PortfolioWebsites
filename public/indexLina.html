                <div class="about-section">
                    <p>Hi, I'm Lina! I'm a third-year Computer Science Co-op student at the University of Ottawa, specializing in web development and AI. Originally from Casablanca, Morocco, I love the sun and the beach. üèñÔ∏è</p>
                    <p>Family-oriented and always striving to be my best, I balance my life with cooking, socializing, and going to the gym. My tech journey began in Summer 2021 when I worked on my portfolio website and coding my CV, which was the start for my web design passion.</p>
                    <p>My first professional role as a Full Stack Developer at OutStem, a University of Ottawa-affiliated startup. There, I launched Sparksite.io, an AI-driven startup that generates thousands of websites with a single click.</p>
                    <p>In Winter 2024, I joined Searidge Technologies, developing AI solutions for airports and applying my skills in real-world scenarios. Alongside my internships, I've been expanding my business. I handle multiple tasks, from software development to managing social media and team assignments on Jira.</p>
                    <p>I'm looking for a Fall 2024 internship to deepen my expertise in web development and AI, and I'm excited about new challenges in tech. Feel free to ask more during an interview!</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: My name in Arabic is written as: "ŸÑŸäŸÜÿß".</p>
